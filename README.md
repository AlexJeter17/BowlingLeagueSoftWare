# BowlingLeagueSoftWare
Although my brother and I began this code in order to assist our current leagues broken software, the corperation from which our league runs from does not allow for third party software. Thus our final edits to the code are put into test.py. Note: test.py uses the BowlingLeagueSpreadsheet_github.xlsx file
