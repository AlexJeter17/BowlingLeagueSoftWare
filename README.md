# BowlingLeagueSoftWare
This is the growth of my own Bowling League Software. Built alongside my brother, we will accomplish a data storing program which holds many attributes of the Classes: BowlingTeam and Player. It is currently a work in progress as we try to complete it by the next league season which occurs in June 2023.
