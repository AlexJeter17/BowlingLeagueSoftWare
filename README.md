# BowlingLeagueSoftWare
This is the growth of my own Bowling League Software. Built alongside my brother, we will accomplish a data storing program which holds many attributes of the Classes: BowlingTeam and Player. It is currently a work in progress as we try to complete it by the next league season which occurs in June 2023.

Noted that it is a work in progress, we have decided to move into python! We will now be uploading .py and .xlsx files for the repository. We will keep the Java files in the repo as a format for us to follow for now. If you are reading this, then they should still be there.
